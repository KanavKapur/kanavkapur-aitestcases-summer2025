Focus on cutting unnecessary costs, like subscriptions or dining out. Try setting aside a small amount each week, even if itâ€™s just $5, into a savings account. Look for ways to increase income, such as freelance work or selling unused items. Consider using apps or tools to manage money more efficiently."
